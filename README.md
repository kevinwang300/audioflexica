# Audioflexica
Welcome to Audioflexica! For these next four weeks, we are going to be exploring how to create a grid and how to make it react to sound!

### Setup
For this project, we will be working on Anaconda Navigator! If you don't have Anaconda, you can click [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)! We will be using Python 2.7 so download the 2.7 version!
