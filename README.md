# Audioflexica
Welcome to Audioflexica! For these next four weeks, we are going to be exploring how to create a grid and how to make it react to sound!

### Setup
For this project, we will be working on Anaconda Navigator! If you don't have Anaconda, you can click [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos)! We will be using Python 2.7 so download the 2.7 version!

After downloading Anaconda, open the navigator and create a new environment and name it whatever you want. Make sure it's in Python 2.7.

[How to create an environment in Anaconda](https://uoa-eresearch.github.io/eresearch-cookbook/recipe/2014/11/20/conda/)

Before we begin our project, we are going to need to download a few packages! Please run the following commands:\
`pip install --upgrade pip`\
`conda install -c anaconda numpy`\
`pip install opensimplex`\
`conda install -c anaconda pyopengl`\
`conda install -c anaconda pyqt`\
`conda install -c anaconda pyaudio`

Now that you have all of the required packages, it's time to begin development!


### Week 1: Learn What PyQTGraph is and how to generate the graph!
[PyQTGraph Documentation](http://pyqtgraph.org/documentation/)

[GLMeshItem Documentation](http://pyqtgraph.org/documentation/3dgraphics/glmeshitem.html?highlight=mesh)
  
### Week 2: Set the color scheme and design the graph to make it look the way you want it to!

### Week 3: Set the offset and incorporate OpenSimplex to create the grid flyover effect!

### Week 4: Add pyAudio and allow the mesh to be able to react to sound input!
