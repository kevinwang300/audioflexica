Welcome to Audioflexica! For these next four weeks, we are going to be exploring how to create a grid and how to make it react to sound!

### Week 1: Learn What PyQTGraph is and how to generate the graph!
[PyQTGraph Documentation](http://pyqtgraph.org/documentation/)

[GLMeshItem Documentation](http://pyqtgraph.org/documentation/3dgraphics/glmeshitem.html?highlight=mesh)
  
### Week 2: Set the color scheme and design the graph to make it look the way you want it to!
[RGBA Color Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGBA_color_space)
  
### Week 3: Set the offset and incorporate OpenSimplex to create the grid flyover effect!
[OpenSimplex Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/opensimplex/)
  
### Week 4: Add pyAudio and allow the mesh to be able to react to sound input!
